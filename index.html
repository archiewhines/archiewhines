<p>Standard Archie Diatribes:
<ol>
  <li value="23">Real estate in Longmont is too expensive.</li>
  <li value="93">Bi-level houses are suboptimal. Tri-levels slightly less so, but still terrible.</li>
  <li>           Two story center hall Colonial houses are the peak of architectural achievement, and constructing any other single-family detacted housing should be a crime.</li>
</ol>
