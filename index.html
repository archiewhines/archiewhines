<p>Standard Archie Diatribes:
<ol>
  <li value="11">Apple is a terrible company and makes terrible products that are impossible to use.</li>
  <li value="23">Real estate in Longmont is too expensive.</li>
  <li value="43">Each cell OEM should be required to ship at least one Android phone with a physical keyboard every year.</li>
  <li value="93">Bi-level houses are suboptimal. Tri-levels slightly less so, but still terrible.</li>
  <li>           Two-story center-hall Colonial houses are the peak of architectural achievement, and constructing any other single-family detached housing should be a crime.</li>
  <li value="103">Europe is weird, and their laws are bad.</li>
  <li value="129">Hand cannons are terrible. Machine guns should be banned from crucible.</li>
  <li>            Warlocks are the best.</li>
</ol>
